# üòä About Me
My name is Kaining Zhang, a Ph.D. student at Wuhan University. My research interests mainly lie in stereo vision and its applications (SLAM, Structure-from-Motion,
large-scale visual localization, etc.). Previously I have been focused on loop closure detection to improve the performance of monocular SLAM (related fields: image retrieval, place recognition, image matching, etc.). Currently I am working on the intersection between 3D geometry and deep learning.

[Loop Closure Detection via Locality Preserving Matching with Global Consensus](https://www.ieee-jas.net/en/article/doi/10.1109/JAS.2022.105926)

[Jiayi Ma](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=73trMQkAAAAJ), **Kaining Zhang**, [Junjun Jiang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=WNH2_rgAAAAJ)

IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica (JAS), 2022
  
- A simple yet surprisingly effective feature matching approach is proposed for scenes within loop closure detection tasks (e.g., scenes with repetitive structures). The algorithm can provide reliable correspondences within only a few milliseconds.

- This is a more complete version of our IROS 2021. We propose a more reasonable loss to revise the motion field, and decrease the time complexity of the algorithm from O(N^3) to O(N). Meanwhile, experiments are conducted on more challenging datasets.
